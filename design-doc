Entity -> collection of components
* contains bitset which says what components it has
* components shouldn't have much logic (only helper functions)
* data is changed/used by systems such as a physics engine or a renderer

EntityPool:
* contains all the entities
* can be queried for specific entities or groups
* returns handles (prob. just the index of that entity)
* everyone has access to this pool

Input (system):
* translates inputs into game specific events and sends them to the msg_bus
* could be with some sort of table that changes depending on the current game state
